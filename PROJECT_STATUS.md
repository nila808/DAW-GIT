## ✅ Current Milestone: `v1.0.3-testpass`

### 🧪 Automated Testing
- ✅ 83/83 tests passing
- ✅ Full end-to-end flow verified
- ✅ No skipped or unstable test cases
- ✅ Snapshot commit logic covered (.als/.logicx)
- ✅ Role tagging, label sync, modal UI, and edge cases tested
- ✅ First-time launch + empty project path scenarios covered

### 🛠️ Code Health
- 💠 New commits normalized to strip Git newline artifacts
- 💚 `NoneType` safety added for `project_path` and `repo`
- 📂 Role persistence fallback logic in `load_commit_roles()`
- 🧼 Cleanup of temp folders and test artifacts on teardown
- ✅ Clean run on PyQt6 (6.9.0) + Python 3.12.3

### 📝 Manual QA (In Progress)
- [ ] Confirm visual label updates after commit (branch/version labels)
- [ ] Verify welcome modal appears on first-time launch
- [ ] Snapshot tagging and DAW-launch behavior under real conditions
- [ ] DAW file previews and commit navigation UX
- [ ] Audio placeholder logic for test-mode commits
